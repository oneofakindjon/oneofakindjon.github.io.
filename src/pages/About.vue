        <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold">Hi! üëã</h1>
        <p class="text-base">
          This website was created by
          <span class="font-bold">Rahul Vaidun</span> I am a 20 year old college
          student from California majoring in Computer Science.
        </p>

        <p class="text-base">
          I created this website as a side project to learn more about Vue.js
          and web development. I also wanted to reverse engineer BeReal's API
          and create a web app that would allow users to view their BeReal data.
          This happens to allow users to also view their friends BeReals without
          posting their own BeReals and screenshot BeReals. This website was
          designed from ground up to work on mobile devices. All the styling is
          done with <span class="font-bold">Tailwind CSS</span>
        </p>
        <p class="text-base">
          If you are interested in viewing the source code or making your own
          contributions to BeFake check out our

        <p class="indent-5">
          See friends' posts without posting anything yourself BeFake allows you
          to see your friends' posts without posting anything yourself. You can
          also screenshot their posts without them getting notified. You can
          also see the location (if available), date and time, retakes,
          comments, and realmoji reactions on all posts. You can even write your
          own comments straight from BeFake.
        </p>

        <p>
          2. Upload your own posts and realmoji reactions! You can also upload
          your own posts with photos from your camera roll, which will be
          visible to your friends. GIFs are also supported, meaning your BeReal
          can be a GIF! The BeFake client also supports custom location with
          longitude and latitude.
